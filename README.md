# Slime Survival 
> Status: Finished ✔️


## **About**:


Slime Survival is a game inspired on Vampire Survivors and it was created as a birthday gift for a friend.
There is no level system, so for progression an item drop system was created. The game has 10 different items, that range from buffs to pets, items to kill on-screen enemies and new weapons.
Future improvements may be added!
